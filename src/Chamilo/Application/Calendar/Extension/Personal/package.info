		<description>&lt;p&gt;A calendar is a system of organizing days for
			social,
			religious, commercial, or administrative
			purposes.
			This is done
			by giving
			names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months, and
			years. The name
			given to
			each day
			is known as a date. Periods in a
			calendar (such as years and
			months) are usually, though not
			necessarily,
			synchronized with the cycle of
			the sun or the moon. Many
			civilizations and societies have devised a
			calendar, usually
			derived
			from other calendars on which they model their
			systems, suited to
			their particular needs.&lt;/p&gt;
