                    With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this
                    faith, we will be able
                    to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of
                    brotherhood. With this faith, we will be
                    able to work together, to pray together, to struggle
                    together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together,
                    knowing that we will be free
