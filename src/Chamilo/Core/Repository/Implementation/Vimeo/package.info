		<description>Vimeo is a U.S.-based video-sharing website on which users can upload, share and view videos. It was
			founded by Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein in November 2004. They left the company in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The
			name Vimeo was created by co-founder Jake Lodwick and is a play on the word video, inserting the word "me" as a
			reference to the site's dedication to user-made video and is also an anagram of the word "movie".</description>
