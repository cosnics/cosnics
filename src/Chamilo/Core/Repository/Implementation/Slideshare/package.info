		<description>SlideShare is a Web 2.0 based slide hosting service. Users can upload files privately or publicly in the
			following file formats: PowerPoint, PDF, Keynote or OpenOffice presentations. Slide decks can then be viewed on the
			site itself, on hand held devices or embedded on other sites. Launched on October 4, 2006, the website is considered
			to be similar to YouTube, but for slideshows. The website was originally meant to be used for businesses to share
			slides among employees more easily, but it has since expanded to also become a host of a large number of slides which
			are uploaded merely to entertain. Although the website is primarily a slide hosting service, it also supports
			documents, PDFs, videos and webinars. SlideShare also provides users the ability to rate, comment on, and share the
			uploaded content. The current list of SlideShare's investors includes Venrock, David Siminoff and Dev Khare.
