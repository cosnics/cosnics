        <description>Flickr is an image hosting and video hosting website, web services suite, and online community that was
            created by Ludicorp in 2004 and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005. In addition to being a popular website for users to share
            and embed personal photographs, the service is widely used by bloggers to host images that they embed in blogs and
            social media. Yahoo reported in June 2011 that Flickr had a total of 51 million registered members and 80 million
            unique visitors. In August 2011 the site reported that it was hosting more than 6 billion images and this number
            continues to grow steadily according to reporting sources. Photos and videos can be accessed from Flickr without the
            need to register an account but an account must be made in order to upload content onto the website. Registering an
            account also allows users to create a profile page containing photos and videos that the user has uploaded and also
            grants the ability to add another Flickr user as a contact. For mobile users, Flickr has an official app for iOS,
            Android, and Windows Phone 7 operating systems.</description>
