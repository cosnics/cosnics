        <description>Picasa is an image organizer and image viewer for organizing and editing digital photos, plus an
            integrated photo-sharing website, originally created by a company named Lifescape (which at that time may have
            resided at Idealab) in 2002 and owned by Google since 2004. "Picasa" is a blend of the name of Spanish painter Pablo
            Picasso, the phrase mi casa for "my house", and "pic" for pictures (personalized art). In July 2004, Google acquired
            Picasa from its original author and began offering it as freeware.</description>
