		<description>Google Drive (formerly known as Google Docs) is a free, Web-based office suite and data storage service
			offered by Google. It allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real-time with other
			users. Google Docs combines the features of Writely and Spreadsheets with a presentation program incorporating
			technology designed by Tonic Systems. Data storage of files up to 1 GB total in size was introduced on January 13,
			2010, but has since been increased to 10 GB, documents using Google Docs native formats do not count towards this
			quota. The largely anticipated cloud storage feature by Google is said to be replacing most of Docs' features in
			2012. This extension or replacement of Google Docs called Google Drive was opened to the public on April 24, 2012.
